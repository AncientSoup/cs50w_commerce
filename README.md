### Note on academic honesty
If you're taking CS50W, either through [Harvard Extension School](https://courses.extension.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/subject/CSCI/33A), [Harvard Summer School](https://courses.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/subject/CSCI/33A) or [OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/), please do not blindly copy paste my code. You are putting yourself at a huge risk for getting excluded from the course by the staff themselves as they grade each project thoroughly.
